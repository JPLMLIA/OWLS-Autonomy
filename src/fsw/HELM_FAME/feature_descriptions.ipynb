    "## Step Angle\n",
    "The step angle measures how much a particle turns at each time point. It gives the angle that a particle deviated from a straight path per inter-frame interval (in radians).

    "## Displacement\n",
    "The displacement metrics measure track characteristics focusing more on wholistic movement (as opposed to inter-frame changes). Where applicable, matrix coordinates are used (In 2D, positive direction of 0th coordinate is downward and positive direction of first coordinate is rightward.)\n",
