# Evaluation

The functionality here is meant to help make simple performance estimates using
predicted tracks (e.g., from `tracker.py`) and ground truth tracks (e.g., from a
simulator).

See `point_metrics.py` for calculation of metrics given track points,
`track_metrics.py` for calculation of metrics given tracks, and `reporting.py`
for functions to calculate batches of metrics and generate plots.
